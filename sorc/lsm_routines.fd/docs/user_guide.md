This directory contains sub-directories with land surface model-specific routines that are utilised elsewhere within UFS_UTILS. Currently, it contains the routines required by global_cycle to perform data assimilation updates to land model states.

This document is part of the <a href="../index.html">UFS_UTILS

The land models included are:

- <a href="../noah/index.html">Noah</a> - routines
