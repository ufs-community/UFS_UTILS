This code creates orographic statistics fields required for the orographic drag suite developed by NOAA's Global Systems Laboratory (GSL).  The fields are a subset of the ones calculated by "orog.fd" except that they are calculated in a different manner.  The fields are:
stddev -- standard deviation of subgrid topography
convexity -- convexity of subgrid topography
oa1,oa2,oa3,oa4 -- orographic asymmetry of subgrid topography (for 4 orientations:
     1-westerly, 2-southerly, 3-southwesterly, 4-northwesterly)
ol1,ol2,ol3,ol4 -- orographic effective length of subgrid topography (for 4 orientations:
     1-westerly, 2-southerly, 3-southwesterly, 4-northwesterly)

Two Cxxx_oro_data files are created:
   - an "ls" (large-scale) file for the gravity wave drag and blocking schemes of Kim and Doyle (QJRMS, 2005)
   - a "ss" (small-scale) file for the small-scale gravity wave drag scheme of Tsiringakis et al. (QJRMS, 2017) and the turbulent orographic form drag (TOFD) scheme of Beljaars et al. (QJRMS, 2004)

The inputs to be passed to the executable are tile number (1-6 for global, 7 for stand-alone regional) and grid resolution, e.g., 768 for C768.

The source data are the following two files to be located in the "fix" directory:
   - geo_em.d01.lat-lon.2.5m.HGT_M.nc -- global topographic data on 2.5-minute lat-lon grid (interpolated from GMTED2010 30-second topographic data)
   - HGT.Beljaars_filtered.lat-lon.30s_res.nc -- global topographic data on 30-second lat-lon grid (GMTED2010 data smoothed according to Beljaars et al. (QJRMS, 2004))
