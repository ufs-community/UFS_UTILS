# Introduction

The cpld_gengrid program and associated script related functions
create the files required for Fix and IC files for the coupled model.

The cpld_gengrid program is part of the
[UFS_UTILS](https://github.com/ufs-community/UFS_UTILS) project.

## Creating Fix and IC files required for the Coupled Model

For the UFS coupled model applications, the following fix files are
required, either for IC warmstart creation, at runtime, or for
post-processing.

- The CICE6 grid and mask file

- The mesh file for the desired OCN/ICE resolution, which is identical
  for MOM6 and CICE6.

- The mapped ocean mask on the FV3 tiles

- The ESMF regridding weights required to map a 1/4 deg MOM6 or CICE6
tripole restart file to a lower tripole resolution.

- The latitude,longitude,depth and mask arrays required by WW3 to
  create a mod_def file for a tripole grid.

- The ESMF regridding weights required to remap the CICE6 or MOM6
  output from tripole grid to a rectilinear grid (optional).

Since MOM6 creates the model grid at runtime (including adjusting the
land mask, if required), the required files for CICE and UFSAtm must
be created in a pre-processing step using only the MOM6 supergrid,
topography and land mask files as input. This allows the mapped ocean
mask (used for creating of the ATM ICs) and the CICE6 grid and mask
files to be consistent with the run-time configuration of MOM6.

## Background:

### MOM6 grids

The MOM6 supergrid contains a MOM6 grid at twice the desired
resolution. The indexing of the supergrid vs the reduced grid is:


            Super Grid               Reduced Grid


        I-1,J+1     I+1,J+1
           X─────X─────X            I-1,J   i,j
           │     │     │               X─────X
           │     │     │               │     │
           │    i│j    │               │  T  │
           X─────X─────X               │     │
           │     │     │               X─────X
           │     │     │          I-1,J-1    I,J-1
           │     │     │
           X─────X─────X
        I-1,J-1     I+1,J-1


MOM6 uses an Arakawa C grid. Within cpld_gridgen, these are referred
to as "stagger" locations, and named as follows:

                 Bu────Cv─────Bu
                 │            │
                 │            │
                 Cu    Ct     Cu
                 │            │
                 │            │
                 Bu────Cv─────Bu


### Rotation angles

For the tripole grid, a rotation angle is defined to translate vectors
to/from the grid (i-j) orientation from/to true E-W. The rotation
angle on ``Ct`` grid points is calculated at run-time in MOM6
(src/initialization/MOM_shared_initialization.F90). However, CICE6
requires a rotation at the corner (``Bu``) grid points. To find these
angles, the rotation angle on ``Ct`` points on the opposite side of
the tripole fold are used. In cpld_gridgen, these values are found by
"flipping over" and changing the sign of the values on the last row of
the MOM6 grid. If ``ipL`` and ``ipR`` are the i-indices of the poles
along the last j-row:


                ipL-1     ipL    ipL+1            ipR-1     ipR    ipR+1
                   x-------x-------x     |||        x-------x-------x

then after folding along the tripole seam, ``ipL`` and ``ipR`` must
align:


                               ipR+1     ipR    ipR-1
                                  x-------x-------x
                               ipL-1     ipL    ipL+1
                                  x-------x-------x


Using the folded seam, the values of the rotation on ``Ct`` points
across the seam are known. The same procedure that CICE uses
internally to calculate the ``Ct`` angles from the ``Bu`` angles can
be used to instead calculate the ``Bu`` angles knowing the ``Ct``
angles.

### SCRIP format files

For calculating interpolation weights using ESMF, a SCRIP file needs
to be provided. A SCIP file contains the both the grid locations of
any stagger grid location (e.g. ``Ct``) and the associated grid
vertices for that point. As seen from the above diagram, for the
``Ct`` points, those grid vertices are given by the ``Bu`` grid
locations.

SCRIP requires that the vertices be ordered counter-clockwise so that
the center grid point is always to the left of the vertex. In
cpld_gridgen, vertices are defined counter-clockwise from upper
right. ``Ct`` vertices are located on the ``Bu`` grid (as shown
above), ``Cu`` vertices on the ``Cv`` grid, ``Cv`` vertices on the
``Cu`` grid and ``Bu`` vertices on the ``Ct`` grid. For example, for
the ``Ct`` grid, the vertices are:

             Vertex #2             Vertex #1
             Bu(i-1,j)             Bu(i,j)
                         Ct(i,j)
           Bu(i-1,j-1)             Bu(i,j-1)
             Vertex #3             Vertex #4


so that the vertices for the ``Ct`` grid are found as off-sets of the
i,j index of the ``Bu`` grid

     iVertCt(4) = (/0, -1, -1,  0/)
     jVertCt(4) = (/0,  0, -1, -1/)

Careful examination of the remaining stagger locations lead to similar
definitions for the i,j offsets required to extract the vertices, all
of which can be defined in terms of the ``iVertCt`` and ``jVertCt``
values.

Special treatment is require at the bottom of the grid, where the
vertices of the ``Ct`` and ``Cu`` grid must be set manually (note,
these points are on land.) The top of the grid also requires special
treatment because the required vertices are located across the tripole
seam. This is accomplished by creating 1-d arrays which hold the
``Ct`` and ``Cu`` grid point locations across the matched seam.

## Generating the grid files

The cpld_gridgen program and associated script related functions
perform the following tasks:

1. read the MOM6 supergrid and ocean mask file and optionally creates
   the required *topo_edits* file if the land mask for MOM6 is to be
   changed at runtime.
2. create a master grid file containing all stagger locations of the
   grid fully defined
3. create the CICE6 grid variables and writes the required CICE6 grid
   file
4. create a SCRIP file for the center stagger (``Ct``) grid points and
   a second SCRIP file also containing the land mask
5. create the ESMF conservative regridding weights to map the ocean
   mask to the FV3 tiles and write the mapped mask to 6 tile files
6. create the ESMF positional weights to map to and from the center
   ``Ct`` grid location.
7. create the EMSF mapping weights to map a tripole grid to a set of
   rectilinear grids
8. use the command line command *ESMF_Scrip2Unstruct* to generate the
   ocean mesh from the SCRIP file containing the land mask (item 4)
9. use an NCO command line command to generate the CICE6 land mask
   file from the CICE6 grid file


## Using ESMF weights for warmstart generation or for ocean-ice post

The ESMF weights generated by ``cpld_gridgen`` are of two types:
**positional weights** and **mapping weights**. Positional weights are
ESMF weights which are used to map to and from the ``Ct`` grid
location. Mapping weights are weights used to map from one domain to
another domain.

In UWM, the ocean and ice **always** run on the same domain because
sea-ice, by definition, can only exist where the ocean exists. The
domain of the ocean and ice for the global models is always the
tripole grid, which is characterized by three "poles", one in the
southern hemisphere and two in the north, both over land.

As seen in the figure, in the northern hemisphere, the model grid
lines (i.e. indices i,j) do not align with true eastward and northward
directions. Therefore, velocities for both MOM6 an CICE6 must be
"rotated" from the model orientation to true geographic orientation
before mapping can take place. This rotation requires that both
components of velocity be co-located at the center ``Ct`` grid point
and requires a set of positional weights **on the source grid**. In
addition, when mapping from one tripole grid to another, weights are
required to re-locate the velocities from the center grid point back
to the native velocity locations. This requires a second set of
positional weights **on the destination grid**.

For ocean-ice "post", fields located at the center grid point of the
source tripole grid are mapped to a destination rectilinear grid.
Thus, both positional weights and mapping weights are generated by
``cpld_gridgen`` for use by ocean-ice post. For downscaling of ocean
or ice restart files the mapping takes place using an ESMF
RouteHandle, in order to correctly account for differing land
masks. Thus, only the positional weights are required for downscaling
of restart files.

## The generated files

The exact list of files produced by the *cpld_gridgen.sh* script will
vary depending on several factors. To generate positional weights, a
SCRIP format file will be produced for each rectilinear destination
grid desired as well for each of the grid locations (``Cu``,``Cv`` or
``Bu``). Positional weights will be generated **to** Ct on the source
grid and **from** Ct on a destination tripole grid. Note also that
multiple intermediate SCRIP format files may be produced depending on
the source tripole grid.
