## Installing

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install ..
make -j2
make install
```

## Contents

The UFS_UTILS package contains the following utilities (under the sorc
directory):
- chgres_cube
- emcsfc_ice_blend
- emcsfc_snow2mdl
- fre-nctools
- fvcom_tools
- global_cycle
- grid_tools
- orog_mask_tools
- sfc_climo_gen
- vcoord_gen

The reg_tests directory contains the consistency test code.

The fix directory is where we set links to directories containing
large, static data files used by UFS_UTILS programs.

The tests directory contains unit tests.

The ush directory contains scripts to run UFS_UTILS programs.  Most
are called from driver scripts.

The util directory contains utility scripts to create coldstart
initial conditions for GFS parallels, and to run the vertical
coordinate generator.

The parm directory contains variable mapping parameter tables used by
the chgres_cube program.

The driver_scripts directory contains high-level driver scripts to
create a model grid on officially supported HPC platforms.

The modulefiles directory contains modules loaded when building
UFS_UTILS on supported HPC platforms.  They are also loaded at runtime
by utility and consistency test scripts.

The docs directory contains the control file for the doxygen
documentation build, as well as some markdown files which are part of
the documentation. It also contains (in the source subdirectory) the
ReadTheDocs documentation files.

The cmake directory contains CMake package find utilities, and utilities to
run units tests on some supported HPC platforms.
