Assuming that given orth33 is a 3*3 proper rotation matrix, derive an axial 3-vector, ax3, such that orth33 is implied by ax3 when the latter is interpreted as encoding a rotation (as in subroutine axtorot)\&. Note that such ax3 are not unique -- adding any multiple of 2*pi times the parallel unit vector leads to the same orth33\&.
