Utility codes for various Mobius transformations\&. If aa1,bb1,cc1,dd1 are the coefficients for one transformation, and aa2,bb2,cc2,dd2 are the coefficients for a second one, then the coefficients for the mapping of a test point, zz, by aa1 etc to zw, followed by a mapping of zw, by aa2 etc to zv, is equivalent to a single mapping zz-->zv by the transformatn with coefficients aa3,bb3,cc3,dd3, such that, as 2*2 complex matrices:

 [ aa3, bb3 ]   [ aa2, bb2 ]   [ aa1, bb1 ]

 [ cc3, dd3 ]   [ cc2, dd2 ]   [ cc1, dd1 ] \&.
