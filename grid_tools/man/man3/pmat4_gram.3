Apply a form of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to return as many normalized orthogonal basis column vectors in matrix B as possible in the space spanned by the columns of matrix A\&. The number of columns returned is the rank, nrank, of A, and the determinant of the projection of A into the subspace of B is returned as det\&.

.PP
A version of gram_d where the determinant information is returned in logarithmic form (to avoid overflows for large matrices)\&. When the matrix is singular, the 'sign' of the determinant, detsign, is returned as zero (instead of either +1 or -1) and ldet is then just the log of the nonzero factors found by the process\&.

.PP
Without changing (tall) rectangular input matrix a, perform pivoted gram- Schmidt operations to orthogonalize the rows, until rows that remain become negligible\&. Record the pivoting sequence in ipiv, and the row-normalization in tt(j,j) and the row-orthogonalization in tt(i,j), for i>j\&. Note that tt(i,j)=0 for i<j (tt is truncated lower triangular)\&. The orthonormalized rows are returned in square array b, which is complete even when the effective rank < n\&. The recorded row operations can be repeated on independent column vectors through the use of subroutine ROWOPS (in this module)\&. It is recommended to rescale the original matrix A via a call to CORRAL (in this module) because the negligibility criterion depends upon an 'epsilon' value that is fixed (10**(-13)) and assumes elements of a are never too different in magnitude from unity, unless they are actually zero\&.
