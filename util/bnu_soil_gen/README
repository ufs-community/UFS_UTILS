Steps to create soil texture class dataset from BNU sand/silt/clay data source

All processing scripts and code are run on NOAA hera HPC

=======================================

1. download original sand,silt,clay data from here:
	http://globalchange.bnu.edu.cn/research/soilw

6 files needed:

CLAY1.nc  SAND1.nc  SILT1.nc
CLAY2.nc  SAND2.nc  SILT2.nc

documentation: Shangguan, W., Dai, Y., Duan, Q., Liu, B. and Yuan, H., 2014. A Global Soil Data Set for Earth System Modeling. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 6: 249-263 .

data notes: 
- horizontal resolution is ~global 30", 84N -> 56S
- vertical resolution: 8 layers to the depth of 2.3 m:
    0     - 0.045 m
    0.045 - 0.091 m
    0.091 - 0.166 m
    0.166 - 0.289 m
    0.289 - 0.493 m
    0.493 - 0.829 m
    0.829 - 1.383 m
    1.383 - 2.296 m

store 6 files in a directory named original/

=======================================

2. convert to texture using NCL; based on USDA soil texture triangle

NCL does not handle the large size of this data so the process is split into 30deg x 30deg tiles

The code produces a texture class for layers 0-1m and 1-2m.

create a directory name tiles/

since there is no data at either pole, run three separate scripts:

convert_to_texture.ncl       : create tiles from 30S to 60N
convert_to_texture_Spole.ncl : create tile  from 30S to 60S
convert_to_texture_Npole.ncl : create tile  from 60N to 90N

Reduced lat organization in the BNU dataset:

lat(beg) = 83.99578
lat(end) = -55.99583

That is, centroids of 84N - 56S, i.e., 90N-60N and 30S-60S are only partially covered.

=======================================

3. stitch tiles, fill missing and make consistent with viirs vegetation

fill in missing value with these rules based on VIIRS land:

where land is snow/ice, soil texture = 16
where water           , soil texture = 14

If missing, search an 11x11 region and use dominant of 12 categories.

If still missing, search a 51x51 region and use dominant of 12 categories.

If still missing, search a 201x201 region and use dominant of 12 categories.

If still missing, set to loam.

fortran code (soil_fill.f90) run on hera with:

module load intel/2022.2.0 netcdf/4.7.0
make
./soil_fill

output notes:

 Num missing before fill:      2536964
 Num missing after fill #1:      61684
 Num missing after fill #2:      22021
 Num missing after fill #3:      19103
 Num missing after filling:          0

The file dataset only uses the 0-1m texture class.

output file will be named bnu_soil.nc

=======================================

4. final formatting to use in ufs_utils

a. create 30s soil file template from viirs vegetation file

cp VEG_LOCATION/vegetation_type.viirs.igbp.30s.nc soil_type.bnu.30s.nc

b. run a bunch of nco commands to get the metadata and naming correct for soil type

ncrename -O -h -v vegetation_type,soil_type soil_type.bnu.30s.nc 
ncatted -h -a landice_category,soil_type,m,i,16 soil_type.bnu.30s.nc

c. replace soil type data from processed file into template file

ncks -A -h -v soil_type bnu_soil.nc soil_type.bnu.30s.nc

d. to save 90+% space compress

ncks -O -h -4 -L 1 soil_type.bnu.30s.nc soil_type.bnu.30s.nc

e. dataset is stored here

hera:/scratch2/NCEPDEV/land/data/input_data/soil_type
