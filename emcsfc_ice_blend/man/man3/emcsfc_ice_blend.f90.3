.PP
Create a global 5-minute blended ice concentration dataset for use by GDAS/GFS\&. This blend is created from National Ice Center Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) data, and the NCEP/MMAB global 5-minute ice concentration data\&.

.PP
This program creates a sea ice concentration file suitable for use by the GFS global cycle program\&. The 5-minute ice concentration file from MMAB can't be used 'as is' because the MMAB data can't give a reliable analysis for small lakes now resolved by the GFS land mask\&.
.PP
This program creates an ice concentration file on the same 5-minute grid as the MMAB data using IMS data from the National Ice Center to fill in small lakes\&. The IMS data is NH only and is a yes/no flag (not a concentration)\&. The IMS data is on a 4km polar stereographic grid and must be interpolated to the MMAB 5-minute grid (NCEP grid 173) before ingest to this program\&. This interpolation may be done using copygb2 as follows:
.PP
.PP
.nf

 grid173='0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4320 2160 0 0 89958000 42000 48 -89958000 359958000 83000 83000 0'
 copygb2 -x -i3 -g '$grid173' ims\&.icec\&.grib2 ims\&.icec\&.5min\&.grib2
 
.fi
.PP
.PP
When using the 'budget' interpolation option (-i3), the IMS yes/no flag will be converted to a pseudo ice concentration\&.
.PP
The IMS data contains a land/water mask\&. Ice concentration is only specified at 'water' points\&.
.PP
The 5-minute data mask contains 'land', 'coast' and 'water' points\&. Ice concentration is specified at 'coast' and 'water', but 'coast' points have error and are not used here\&.
.PP
The blending process is as follows in the NH:
.IP "1." 4
If IMS indicates 'land', then the blended value is set to 'land' and is bitmapped out\&.
.IP "2." 4
If the IMS is 'water', and the MMAB data point is 'coast' or 'land', the IMS ice concentration is used as the blended value\&.
.IP "3." 4
If IMS and MMAB indicate a point as water, then
.IP "  \(bu" 4
The blended value is set to zero if the IMS concentration is less than 50%\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
If the IMS concentration is >=50%, then the neighboring 5-minute data is checked for ice\&. 
.br
 * If the 5-minute point is ice free, but at least one of its neighbors has ice, the blended value is set to the IMS ice concentration\&. Examination of the 5-minute showed isolated open water points within large areas of ice\&. This logic attempts to remove these likely wrong points\&.
.IP "    \(bu" 6
If (i) is false, then the blended value is set to the 5-minute value or 15%, whichever is greater\&. 15% is the lower threshold in the MMAB 5-minute product\&.

In the SH, the blended value is simply the 5-minute ice concentration at 'water' points\&. 'Coast' and 'land' points are bitmapped out\&.
