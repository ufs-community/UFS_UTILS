These directory contains copies of the noah LSM code needed to make any land state adjusments made neceessary by the DA updates\&. For noah, routines not labelled public/private, will shorty be replaced, and are very unlikely to change\&. For now, have made a second copy of the relevant routines\&.
.PP
The copied versions are from: https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics -b master, commit 08b72bc1c23c48a823626d81f8e0a398685a35a3 (dated May, 2021)\&. (used this version, as is formatted for doxygen\&. output zero diff to version in the global_workflow)\&.
.PP
Files directly copied: namelist_soilveg\&.f set_soilveg\&.f -> needed some changes for doxygen
.PP
sflx_snippet\&.f is a snippet of the file sflx\&.F, with minor changes to compil, and to enable frh2o routine to be called externally\&.
