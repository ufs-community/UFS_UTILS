# A note on flushing Action cache and relevance to "cache_key" above.
# There is no way to flush the Action cache, and hence a number (#) is appended
# to the "cache_key" (gcc).
# If the dependencies change, increment this number and a new cache will be
# generated by the dependency build step "setup"
# There is a Github issue to force clear the cache.
# See discussion on:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63521430/clear-cache-in-github-actions

# The jobs are split into:
# 1. a dependency build step (setup), and
# 2. a UPP build step (build)
# The setup is run once and the environment is cached,
# so each build of UPP can reuse the cached dependencies to save time (and compute).
