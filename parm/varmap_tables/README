These files, each named for the phys_suite variable set in the chgres_cube namelist, 
control how chgres_cube, when processing grib2 files, handles variables that might
be missing from the grib2 files. Since there are so many different version of grib2
files, it's often uncertain what fields are available even if you know what source
model the data is coming from. Each file contains :

Line 1: number of entries in the table
Column 1: Name the code searches for in the table. Do not change.
Column 2: Name the code will use to save the variable in the output file. Unimplemented.
Comumn 3: Behavior when the code can't find the variable in the input file. Options are:
	  "skip": Don't write to output file.
	  "set_to_fill": Set to user-specified field value (see column 4).
	  "stop": Force an exception and stop code execution. Use this if you absolutely
		require a field to be present.
Column 4: If column 3 = "set_to_fill", then this value is used to fill in all points 
	  in the input field. These values may be over-written by the code before 
	  output depending on the variable (esp. for surface variables). Be careful
	  with these values for surface variables. If you set this value too low 
	  (e.g., -100000), the code may run extremely slowly due to variable replacment
	  at "missing" points.
