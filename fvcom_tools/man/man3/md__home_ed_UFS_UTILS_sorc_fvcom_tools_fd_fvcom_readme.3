replaces lake surface and lake ice temperature \fBfvcom_to_FV3\&.exe\fP
.PP
\fBIntroduction:\fP This code replaces lake surface and lake ice temperature along with aerial ice concentration generated from Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS), an FVCOM-based model, into sfc_data\&.nc\&. \fBNOTE\fP that the variables in the input files must reside on the same grid\&. This means data from FVCOM must be horizontally interpolated to the FV3 grid\&. This routine will also force a minimum ice concentration of 15%\&. If ice concentration is less than 15% in FVCOM, it will be set to 0% to avoid FV3 from changing values less than 15% to 15% and generating unrealistic lake ice temperatures\&.
.PP
\fBLibrary Dependencies:\fP Installation depends on the netCDF library and cmake\&.
.PP
\fBRunning:\fP This routine will take two variables from the command line:
.IP "1." 4
Name of FV3 sfc data file (e\&.g\&. sfc_data\&.tile7\&.halo0\&.nc) which is generated from chgres_cube\&.exe\&.
.IP "2." 4
Name of FVCOM data file in netcdf format (e\&.g\&. fvcom\&.nc)
.PP
.PP
To run the script, use the following example, modifying file names as needed: \&./fvcom_to_FV3 sfc_data\&.tile7\&.halo0\&.nc fvcom\&.nc Output will be to the sfc data file and include lake surface and lake ice temperature, and lake ice concentration from FVCOM\&.
.PP
This routine is \fIstrongly\fP based upon Eric James' (ESRL/GSL) work to update HRRR/WRF Great Lakes' temperature data with FVCOM\&. It also relies heavily on Ming Hu's (ESRL/GSL) ncio module\&.
