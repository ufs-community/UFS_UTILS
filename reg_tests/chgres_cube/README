This series of consistency tests must be run before any
changes to the chgres_cube program are merged to the
main line of development.  Any test failures must
be resolved or explained before merging.

To run the consistency tests:

1) Build chgres_cube program.  Go to ./sorc and
   invoke 'build_all.sh' with no arguments.
2) Invoke driver script for your machine.  See script
   prolog for details.  Supported machines are:
   - Hera (driver.hera.sh)
   - WCOSS-Cray (driver.cray.sh)
   - WCOSS-Dell (driver.dell.sh)
   - Jet (driver.jet.sh)
   - Orion (driver.orion.sh)

A series of daisy-chained tests will run.  A test fails 
if the output files differ from the baseline set of files
as determined by the 'nccmp' utility.

Log output from the tests will be in "regression.log".

A summary of results will be in "summary.log".
