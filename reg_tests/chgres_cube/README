This series of consistency tests must be run before any
changes to the chgres_cube program are merged to the
main line of development.  Any test failures must
be resolved or explained before merging.

To run the consistency tests:

1) Build chgres_cube program.  Go to ./sorc and
   invoke 'build_all.sh' with no arguments.
2) Set the fixed directories. Go to ./fix and
   invoke the script.
3) Invoke driver script for your machine.  See script
   prolog for details.

A series of tests will run.  A test fails if the output
files differ from the baseline set of files as determined
by the 'nccmp' utility.

Log output from each test will be placed in its own
logfile - "consistency.log??".

A summary of results will be in "summary.log".
