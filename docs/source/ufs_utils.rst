chgres_cube
===========

.. include:: chgres_cube.rst

make_hgrid
==========

Introduction
------------

The make_hgrid program computes geo-referencing parameters for global uniform grids.  (Extended Schmidt gnomonic regional grids are created by the regional_esg_grid program.)  The parameters include geographic latitude and longitude, and grid cell area.  See the output data section for a full list of parameters.  Grids are gnomonic such that all great circles are straight lines.  The parameters are computed on the staggered or "supergrid" - which has twice the resolution of the model grid.  The chgres_cube initialization program maps mass fields - such as temperature - at the supergrid centroids, and u/v winds at the face mid-points.  The supergrid is shown here:

global_equiv_resol
==================

Introduction
------------

This program computes the global equivalent resolution for regional grids.  For example, a global grid with x/y dimensions of 96 would have a global resolution (CRES) of C96.  And the approximate physical resolution would be:

      * Res in km = (360 degrees / 4*CRES) * 111 km = 104 km 

Using the average cell size (in m^2) of the regional grid, the equivalent global resolution is computed according to:

      * CRES = nint( (2*pi*rad_earth)/(4*avg_cell_size) )

There are no runtime-selectable options for this program.

orog
====

Introduction
------------

This program computes the land mask, land fraction, orography and gravity wave drag (GWD) fields on the model grid.  See the output data section for a complete list of fields.

Land-sea mask and land fraction are created from a global 30-arc second University of Maryland land cover (land/non-land flag) dataset.  Land fraction is determined by averaging all 30-second land cover points located within the model grid box.   Points with a land fraction of 50% or more are given a land-sea mask of "land".  Orography and GWD fields are created from two datasets: 1) 30-arc-second `USGS GMTED2010 <https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/eros/coastal-changes-and-impacts/gmted2010?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con>`_ orography data; 2) for Antarctica, 30-arc-second `RAMP <https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0082>`_ terrain data (Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project).  Fields are determined from all 30-arc second data located within the model grid box.  The orography is simply the average of the 30-arc second values.  It is later filtered by the filter_topo program.  For details on the GWD fields, see:

filter_topo

Introduction

The FV3 terrain filtering algorithm has several unique properties compared to conventional topography filters. The resulting topography filtered by this algorithm has conserved globally integrated elevations. More importantly, this filter has the following island-preserving properties: 1) No Gibbs ringing at the coastlines where discontinuities occur; 2) the filtered terrain's coastlines strictly match the source terrain's. The detailed implementation of this terrain filtering algorithm will be described in a forthcoming publication by Dr. Shian-Jiann Lin and his group.

The sfc_climo_gen (surface climatological field generation) program creates surface climatological fields such as soil type, vegetation type and albedo.  Some fields may be time-varying: for example, snow-free albedo is monthly.  But they are static - i.e., they only need to be generated when the grid is created.  The program uses the ESMF library to horizontally interpolate the source data to the model grid.  For regional grids, the program will output files with and without the halo region when the "halo" namelist variable is set.

      * search.f90 - Replace undefined values on the model grid with a valid value at a nearby neighbor. Undefined values are typically associated with isolated islands where there is no source data.
      * source_grid.F90 - Reads the grid specifications and land/sea mask for the source data.  Sets up the ESMF grid object for the source grid.

vcoord_gen   
==========

Introduction
------------

This program generates hybrid coordinate parameters from fields such as surface pressure, model top and the number of vertical levels. Outputs the 'ak' and 'bk' parameters used by the forecast model and chgres_cube to define the hybrid levels as follows:

      * pressure = ak + (surface_pressure * bk)

Code structure
--------------

Location of the source code: ./sorc/vcoord_gen.fd.

Program inputs
--------------

The following user-defined parameters are read in from standard input.

     * levs - Integer number of levels
     * lupp - Integer number of levels below pupp
     * pbot - Real nominal surface pressure (Pa)
     * psig - Real nominal pressure where coordinate changes from pure sigma (Pa)
     * ppre - Real nominal pressure where coordinate changes from pure pressure (Pa)
     * pupp - Real nominal pressure where coordinate changes to upper atmospheric profile (Pa)
     * ptop - Real pressure at top (Pa)
     * dpbot - Real coordinate thickness at bottom (Pa)
     * dpsig - Real thickness of zone within which coordinate changes to pure sigma (Pa)
     * dppre - Real thickness of zone within which coordinate changes to pure pressure (Pa)
     * dpupp - Real coordinate thickness at pupp (Pa)
     * dptop - Real coordinate thickness at top (Pa)

Program outputs
---------------

A text file is output containing the 'ak' and 'bk' values. To use it in chgres_cube, set namelist variable "vcoord_target_grid" to the path/name of this file.

Run script
----------

To run, use script ./util/vcoord_gen/run.sh
